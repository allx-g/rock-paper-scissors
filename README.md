Rock Paper Scissors
========

Rock Paper Scissors is the classic 2-player game played with hands but recreated virtually on a GameBoy:tm:-esque display played against the computer.

This is also a project submission for The Odin Project.

Rules
--------

- The game is "best of 5". Once a player reaches 3, the game wins and that player wins the whole game.
